vue files single page component. 

every vue app made 3 parts, html template, script where we export the componenet object and style tag for styling to template. Script and Style optional.
create template for component within component file.

template refs - allow us to take a bit of the DOM, store in variable and do regulart javascript stuff with it

same logic with components with single page componenets - extract logic where you can, keep components readable
